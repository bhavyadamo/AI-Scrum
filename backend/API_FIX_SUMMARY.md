# API Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The API was returning a 404 Not Found error for the endpoint:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/work-items/team-members
```

## Root Cause
The team-members endpoint was not implemented in the backend API.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Team Members Controller Method:**
   - Created a `getTeamMembers` method in the `WorkItemController` class
   - Added mock data for team members to ensure immediate functionality
   - Implemented proper error handling and response formatting

2. **Added Route Definition:**
   - Added a new route for `/team-members` in the `workItemRoutes.ts` file
   - Positioned the route before the `/:id` route to prevent route conflicts

3. **Implemented Azure DevOps Service Method:**
   - Added a `getTeamMembers` method to the `AzureDevOpsService` class
   - Implemented logic to fetch team members from Azure DevOps API
   - Added fallback to mock data if API call fails (due to permission issues)
   - Created appropriate interfaces for team member data

4. **Updated Port Number:**
   - Changed the server port from 3000 to 5000 to match the frontend's expected endpoint

5. **Created Server Starter Script:**
   - Added `start-server.js` to provide an easy way to start the server
   - Supports both development mode (with ts-node) and production mode (with compiled code)

## How to Test

1. Start the server:
   ```
   node start-server.js
   ```

2. Open your browser or use a tool like Postman to access:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/work-items/team-members
   ```

3. You should now see a JSON response with team member data instead of a 404 error.

## Next Steps

1. When the PAT token permissions are updated, the actual Azure DevOps team member data will be retrieved
2. Until then, the API will return mock data, ensuring the frontend can continue development
3. The mock data structure matches what would be returned from Azure DevOps API
